# Object-Detection

Object Detection using python and OpenCV

* Here, the objects in a given video and images are detected using Haarscascade files and OpenCV. 

* You can download Haarscascade files in this repository or in https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades

* In the notebooks I have created a classifier and then detected the objects in a given video or an image.
